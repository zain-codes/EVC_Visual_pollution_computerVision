# Visual Pollution Detection with Computer Vision

This project addresses the pervasive issue of visual pollution in urban environments through advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing state-of-the-art algorithms like YOLOv8, this initiative aims to identify and analyze complex patterns of visual pollution in real-time. 

## Project Overview

The training process involved dividing the dataset into training and validation sets, applying rigorous cross-validation, and optimization techniques to refine our machine learning model. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix were integral to assessing the model's effectiveness.

### Key Results

- **Enhanced Object Detection**: Integration of YOLOv8 enabled more accurate and real-time identification of visual pollution.
- **Model Evaluation**: Utilization of a normalized confusion matrix and precision to confidence measures showcased the model's predictive capabilities.

## Future Work

To enhance the robustness and applicability of our solution, future iterations will focus on:

- Collecting more diverse data samples to improve model generalization.
- Implementing advanced data augmentation techniques.
- Expanding the dataset and testing various object detection architectures.
- Applying multinomial techniques such as One vs. One strategy for better handling of class imbalance.
- Conducting hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the model, e.g., increasing the number of epochs for improved learning outcomes.
